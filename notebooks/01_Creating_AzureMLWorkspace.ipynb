    "We recommend that you keep all configuration files in the `conf` directory of a Kedro project. However, if you prefer, you may point Kedro to any other directory and change the configuration paths by overriding `CONF_ROOT` variable from the derived `ProjectContext` class in `src/<project-package>/run.py` as follows:\n",

    "Kedro-specific configuration (e.g., `DataCatalog` configuration for IO) is loaded using the `ConfigLoader` class:\n",

    "from kedro.config import ConfigLoader\n",
    "\n",
    "conf_paths = [\"conf/base\", \"conf/local\"]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will recursively scan for configuration files firstly in `conf/base/` and then in `conf/local/` directory according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ANY of the following is true:\n",
    "  * filename starts with `catalog` OR\n",
    "  * file is located in a sub-directory whose name is prefixed with `catalog`\n",
    "* AND file extension is one of the following: `yaml`, `yml`, `json`, `ini`, `pickle`, `xml` or `properties`\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration information from files stored in `base` or `local` that match these rules is merged at runtime and returned in the form of a config dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If any 2 configuration files located inside the same environment path (`conf/base/` or `conf/local/` in this example) contain the same top-level key, `load_config` will raise a `ValueError` indicating that the duplicates are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note:* Any top-level keys that start with `_` character are considered hidden (or reserved) and therefore are ignored right after the config load. Those keys will neither trigger a key duplication error mentioned above, nor will they appear in the resulting configuration dictionary. However, you may still use such keys for various purposes. For example, as [YAML anchors and aliases](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/yaml-anchors-960154027.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "* If 2 configuration files have duplicate top-level keys, but are placed into different environment paths (one in `conf/base/`, another in `conf/local/`, for example) then the last loaded path (`conf/local/` in this case) takes precedence and overrides that key value. `ConfigLoader.get(<pattern>, ...)` will not raise any errors, however a `DEBUG` level log message will be emitted with the information on the over-ridden keys.\n",
    "* If the same environment path is passed multiple times, a `UserWarning` will be emitted to draw attention to the duplicate loading attempt, and any subsequent loading after the first one will be skipped."

To install extras, specify them in brackets as shown here:\n",
