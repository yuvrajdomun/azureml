    "# Reviewing Automated Machine Learning Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "As machine learning becomes more and more and more prevelant, the predictions made by models have greater influence over many aspects of our society. For example, machine learning models are an increasingly significant factor in how banks decide to grant loans or doctors prioritise treatments. The ability to interpret and explain models is increasingly important, so that the rationale for the predictions made by machine learning models can be explained and justified, and any inadvertant bias in the model can be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use automated machine learning to train a model, you have the option to generate explanations of feature importance that quantify the extent to which each feature (including engineered features that were generated by preprocessing transformations) influences label prediction. In this lab, you'll explore the explanations generated by an automated machine learning experiment.\n",
